I have concerns with how Duo does phone two-factor authentication and think we can all learn from the way Google does it.</p>
<p>
The issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a user has their password compromised it’s easy to convince them to authenticate a 2-factor request without doing anything that would set off a red flag. This is due to the specific way Duo does phone call authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attacker required information:</p>
<ul>
<li>User password</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
</ul>
<p>The attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat actor compromises a password</li>
<li>Threat actor uses OSINT to determine victim’s phone number based on the last 4 numbers that duo discloses in the 2-factor login.</li>
<li>Threat actor calls the victim and uses any facade to convince a user to merge a call (transferring between departments, bringing manager to the call, verification call to verify phone number (My phone carrier has done this))</li>
<li>Threat actor send two factor phone request and user merges the call.</li>
<li>Threat actor (not user) presses a key to authenticate the 2-factor request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>User only needs to be convinced to merge a call- this will probably not set off a red flag since it’s not a probe for more information.</li>
<li>Duo does not tell the user what is being authenticated that would set off any red flags</li>
<li>Duo accepts input before the the push call explains the context of the call</li>
</ul>
<p>How to fix this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full disclosure of the context of the call before accepting user input ex: “You are authenticating for user@account.com. If you were not expecting this call please hang up now otherwise press any key after the beep”</li>
<li>Switch to the method Google uses: Give context for the call and give the users a token to type in. This gives a user more time to realize something is wrong</li>
</ul>
