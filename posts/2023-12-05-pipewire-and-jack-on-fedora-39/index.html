I recently switched from a MacBook Pro to an AMD Framework 13 Laptop. That means that I need to actually figure out how to make Linux audio work.</p>
<p>
There were no issues using Pipewire for ALSA sound but I was unable to get Jack clients connected with errors like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
Cannot connect to server request channel jack server is not running or cannot be started
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which lead me to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/15a184k/if_you_want_to_use_pipewire_jack_you_need_this/">https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/15a184k/if_you_want_to_use_pipewire_jack_you_need_this/</a></p>
<p>
Because there were no specific pipewire configs in my <code class="verbatim">/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> folder I assumed this was probably my issue as well since this had previously fixed  a similar issue on my previous debian install.</p>
<p>
But the other bummer is that this file was nowhere to be found in Fedora 39- it DID appear it was in another version of <code class="verbatim">pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit</code> but I was not interested in overwriting the system installed version of that package</p>
<p>
So the solution for me was to go grab the RPM and copy the file from there:</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Download the package that provides pipewire-jack-x86_64.conf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>dnf download pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit-1.0.0-1.fc39
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Extract it</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rpm2cpio pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit-1.0.0-1.fc39.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Move it</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo mv pipewire-jack-x86_64.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Load it</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo ldconfig</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
And that was it, the jack server started and clients could connect.</p>
<p>
Deep diving into Linux audio systems avoided for another year</p>
