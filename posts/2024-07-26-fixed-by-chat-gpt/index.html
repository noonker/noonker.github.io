You are a scholar of technical writing and the english language. Please give me a summary of what the writer was trying to say:
Summary The writer discusses the evolution of their communication style, initially emphasizing correctness and spelling but now prioritizing speed and humor, even at the expense of errors. They reflect on how technology, specifically AI, has changed communication. While AI can handle some interactions, the writer stresses the importance of human-to-human communication, particularly in situations where nuance and personality are crucial. They highlight the potential loss of human voice when AI mediates conversations and argue for using AI selectively, suggesting that only the receiver might benefit from AI assistance. The essay concludes with a plea to maintain humanity in communication, emphasizing that AI should not replace the human touch in meaningful interactions.
