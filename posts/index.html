      Intro I used to be a person who cared greatly about ensuring that my prose were correct, and that I spelled everything correctly.
I'm actually going to avoid that here and I'm not even going to bother with a spell checker. For most casual communication I now like to focus on being fast and funny at the expense of the red squiggly lines or appeasing the specter of my english teacher.

      Installing Komplete in Wine to use with the AWESOME tool yabridge has a big pain point
The .iso applications will not install because they do not mount correctly
<a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#known-issues-and-fixes">https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#known-issues-and-fixes</a>
The fix here is fine but there's one gotcha:
The documentation says that you should take two steps to install the packages with wine:
udisksctl loop-setup -f ~/Downloads/&lt;filename&gt;.iso # load the .iso file udisksctl mount -t udf -o unhide -b /dev/loopX # where /dev/loopX corresponds to the loop device printed by the loop-setup The problem is that in Fedora 39 once you create the loop device it will automount.

      I recently switched from a MacBook Pro to an AMD Framework 13 Laptop. That means that I need to actually figure out how to make Linux audio work.
There were no issues using Pipewire for ALSA sound but I was unable to get Jack clients connected with errors like:
Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory Cannot connect to server request channel jack server is not running or cannot be started JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock

      If you're a subscriber to this blog, thank you. This is almost certainly not interesting for you.
If you're the owner of a Roland FR-4x digital accordion and trying to find which USB sticks can be used with your accordion I tried out every stick in my house with no luck. I learned:
They need to be FAT32 (not ExFat) They need to be USB2.0 16GB seems to be the ideal size?

      I came across this article on Hackernews by Richard Nordquist on Soft Language.
This is one of those articles I read and it wasn't apparent that this would resonate with me as hard as it did. I've heard of concepts like the &quot;euphemism treadmill&quot; before but this is the first time I'm thinking of language being soft.
Is it better to use &quot;hard&quot; language? Is it more honest? Or do we just need to be more cognizant of not softening our language unintentionally?
