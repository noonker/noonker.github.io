      <description>Intro I used to be a person who cared greatly about ensuring that my prose were correct, and that I spelled everything correctly.&#xA;I&amp;#39;m actually going to avoid that here and I&amp;#39;m not even going to bother with a spell checker. For most casual communication I now like to focus on being fast and funny at the expense of the red squiggly lines or appeasing the specter of my english teacher.</description>
