      <title>Using Org-Mode to Manage Configs</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve just started to use Org-Mode as a way to manage my configs. Previously I&amp;#39;ve kept my configs in a git repo and just had a post-install script to put all the configs in the right place.
 For now, I&amp;#39;m testing using Org-Mode for this purpose and I think I like the results.
 I have a config.org file that is arranged something like this:
#+TITLE: Configs - Tangle a single block with =C-u C-c C-v t= - Tangle all blocks with =C-v C-c t= #+name: secret #+begin_src emacs-lisp:var name=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;, fld=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; (if (string-equal fld &amp;#34;password&amp;#34;) (password-store-get name) (password-store-get-field name fld)) #+end_src *tmux #+begin_src bash:noweb tangle :tangle ~/.</description>

      <title>Elfeed Rules!</title>

      <description>I recently got the question- &amp;#34;What is the use case for elfeed?&amp;#34;. When I get a chance to talk about my favorite software I will NEVER pass up that opportunity.
 Elfeed is a RSS feed reader for Emacs that I use daily and it solves a lot of problems for me. To understand how this works let&amp;#39;s start by looking at a snippet of my feeds config. Elfeed feeds is just a list of lists where each feed is represented by (url tag1 tag2 tagN) .</description>
