decoupling the address from the service
&lt;/h3>

I’ve been using gmail since it was an invite only beta. My email address has accumulated so much garbage over the years and finding important emails has become almost as difficult as determining important calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
I recently switched to Protonmail due to privacy concerns with Google’s monopoly on data. I had hoped I could use this transition to slowly shift important emails to a new address. This just made things worse. I also didn’t want to rely on another company- because like all things in technology there are’s no way to know how long before I need to switch to another service.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
