I came across &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/soft-language-euphemism-1692111">this article&lt;/a> on Hackernews by Richard Nordquist on Soft Language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This is one of those articles I read and it wasn&amp;#39;t apparent that this would resonate with me as hard as it did. I&amp;#39;ve heard of concepts like the &amp;#34;euphemism treadmill&amp;#34; before but this is the first time I&amp;#39;m thinking of language being soft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Is it better to use &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; language? Is it more honest? Or do we just need to be more cognizant of not softening our language unintentionally?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
